Overview

The Standing Order APIs enable teams to integrate with the standing order solution by initiating a request to create a standing order on the customer profile.

Audience

This API is intended for businesses who wish to integrate with standing orders for the automation of recurring revenue collection.

**“NB: To consume this API, you will need to go through the documentation below, create a sandbox app with M-pesa Ratiba product and test using our simulator. Upon successful testing, email us at [apisupport@safaricom.co.ke](mailto:apisupport@safaricom.co.ke) for Go Live as this is a commercial API. Our team will reach out for commercial discussion and contract signing and thereafter avail the API to your pay bill or till number.”**

Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Knowledge of RESTful principles and JSON.
2. Understanding Asynchronous processing and callback handling.
3. Set up an App on Daraja to be used for testing on the simulator. Ensure to select "M-Pesa Ratiba" when creating the app

M-PESA Ratiba API is an extension of the Safaricom Standing order functionality that will allow third party integrators to avail this functionality to their users.

(STK Push/NI push) is a Merchant/Business initiated prompt, that will allow M-Pesa user to enter their pin for authentication and user validation purposes.

Once you, our merchant integrate with the API, you will be able to send a pin prompt on the customer's phone (Popularly known as STK Push Prompt) to your customer's M-PESA registered phone number requesting them to enter their M-PESA pin to authorize, and continue with the rest of the journey involving opt in and creating a standing order.

## High Level user flow

* A user will probably interact with the integrated API through the merchant’s digital channel, could be a web interface or an app interface. The user will enter the standing order details, including the name, amount, start date, end date, etc. – (As per the merchant’s configurations on the digital channel.)
* The merchant channel, through the API will send the data to our systems. Here we will run the authentication checks through our gateway. Once authenticated, we will initiate an NI push to the M-Pesa user. The user will enter their pin. This will be consent to proceed with all operations coming after and also validate ownership of the MSISDN.
* We will run a check to see if the user is opted in, if not, we will opt the user in. If the user is opted in, we will proceed with the request to create a standing order.
* We will then send a callback to the merchant, with the status of the process, the transaction code and the unique response id
