# Business Buy Goods API

Pay for goods and services directly from your business account to a till number, merchant store number, or Merchant HO.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa/b2b/v1/paymentrequest`

## Overview

This API enables you to pay for goods and services directly from your business account to a till number, merchant store number, or Merchant HO. You can also use this API to pay a merchant on behalf of a consumer/requestor.

The transaction moves money from your MMF/Working account to the recipient's merchant account.

## How It Works

1. The merchant prepares and sends a payment request to the M-PESA B2B API endpoint with `CommandID: BusinessBuyGoods`
2. The API Management Platform validates, authorizes, and authenticates the request, forwards it to M-PESA, and sends an acknowledgment to the merchant
3. M-PESA validates the request and processes the transaction
4. M-PESA sends the transaction response to the merchant via the specified callback URL
5. Both parties receive transaction confirmation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Daraja Account on Safaricom Developer Portal
- Sandbox app with API credentials (Consumer Key & Consumer Secret)
- Initiator Username with Org Business Buy Goods API initiator role on M-Pesa
- Initiator Password (encrypted using the public key certificate)
- Business shortcode (PartyA) with sufficient funds in MMF/Working account

### Good to Know
This API is asynchronous. You will receive an immediate acknowledgment, and the final result is sent to your ResultURL.
